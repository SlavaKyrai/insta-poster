The idea of the project was to create automatic social media reposting tool, from one media to another. 
For example, get some posts from Reddit And Post them to a Telegram Channel or Instagram Account. 
It also has some functionality for promoting Instagram accounts by following other people or liking their posts.

There are 2 apps:
- crawlers (responsible for crawling posts from Reddit or other sources)
- posters (for posting data on social media)

Crawling and posting data configured via models.py 
And function responsible for posting located into tasks.py modules. 

The project was done for education and fun purposes. 
Todo: add tests, linter
